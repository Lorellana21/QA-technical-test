# technical-test

Hello!
This is a technical-test to show my skills such as Junior QA Engineer for Bdeo as they are growing the QA team ðŸ’ª

The test consists of accessing this [page](https://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/#/) and
write automatic tests to test:
- The functionality of adding a to-do
- The functionality to complete a to-do
- The filters of to-do's (active / completed / all)


**Functionality of adding a to-do**

1. Add a single to-do:
    input: write a single to-do,
    output: the to-do list must have length 1.

2. Add 3 to-dos:
    input: introduce 3 to-dos,
    output: the to-do list must have length 3.

3. The to-dos render the correct text within the app:
    input: introduce 3 to-dos,
    output: every "li" label renders the text introduced.

4. The footer or to-do-list do not display when there are no to-dos:
    input: no to-do introduced,
    output: no to-do list or footer rendered within the app.

**Functionality to complete a to-do**

5. When the to-do is completed, it gets a different class:
    input: introduce a to-do and mark as completed
    output: the class "completed" appears in the li(to-do) clicked

**Filters of to-do's (active / completed / all)**
